# ART OF ELECTRONICS - microNotes

## Chapter 1 Part 2 - Capacitor

- Three linear passive 2 terminal circuit elements - resistor, capacitor, inductor
- Memristor - non linear element 

### Capacitor 
- Applications of Capacitor 
    - waveform generation
    - filtering
    - blocking or coupling (major)
    - bypass (major)
    - integrators
    - differentiators
- Condenser
- Q = CxV
- C = 8.85x10^-14 eA/d F 
- e - dielectric constant
- frequency dependent resistor
- Ideal Capacitor cannot dissipate power as voltage and current are 90 degrees
- I = C dV/dt - current proportional to change in voltage
- pF, nF, uF, mF
- U = 1/2 CV^2
- Capacitors in Series and Capacitors in Parallel

**Note: *Varactors - Voltage variable capacitor made from a PN junction***
